# Teams

Teams can be used to organize groups of members in an app. Typically teams represent users that are
linked together somehow. For example they belong to the same organizational unit or they are class
mates. App managers can view and manage teams from the _Teams_ page in the app page in Appsemble
Studio. In order to become a team member, a user must first be registered as an app member. They can
do so by logging into the app. Teams determine how its members can share resources with each other.

To enable teams, first `security.teams` needs to be enabled in the app definition. For more
information, see [teams security](security.md#teams)

## Roles

Within a team a user has one of the roles _Manager_ or _Member_. The exact difference between these
roles is determined by the security roles in the app definition. From a security perspective it’s
most important to configure resource roles correctly. For a good user experience, it’s best to make
sure the app pages match the resource security definitions.

### Resources

If a resource `create` definition specifies a role of `$team:manager`, only a user who is a manager
of a team may create such a resources. If the role is `$team:member`, only a user who is a team
member may create such a resource. The latter includes the team manager.

If a resource action definition other than `create` specifies a role of `$team:member`, then any
team members of the resource author may perform the action on that resource. If the role is
`$team:manager`, then only the managers of the teams the author is in may perform that action on the
resource.

For example, let’s say we have an app for managing a soccer club:

```yaml
name: Soccer club

resources:
  strategy:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        description:
          type: string
          multiline: true
    create:
      roles:
        - $team:manager
    query:
      roles:
        - $team:member
    get:
      roles:
        - $team:member

  absence:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        date:
          type: string
          format: date
    create:
      roles:
        - $team:member
    query:
      roles:
        - $team:manager
    get:
      roles:
        - $team:manager
```

We have the following teams:

**Red team**:

- Manny (manager)
- James
- Alex

**Blue team**:

- Mandy (manager)
- Jessie
- Alex

Each soccer team has their own strategy. Only the team manager may create a strategy. Manny may
create a strategy (`$team:manager`), meaning they are now the author of that strategy. Because James
and Alex are in the same team as Manny, they may view the strategy (`$team:member`).

Mandy is the manager of the blue team. This means they can also create a strategy (`$team:manager`),
which can then be viewed by Jessie and Alex (`$team:member`). Because Alex is in both the red and
the blue team, Alex can see both strategies.

Sometimes players (represented by team members) can’t be present at a game. In this case they need
to report themselves absent. Players can only report their own absence (`$team:member`) using a
create action. Let’s say Jamie calls in sick. Now only Manny can see this (`$team:manager`).
However, if Alex reports absence, both Manny and Mandy can see it.

### Pages

Page security rules should match that of the data they display. Otherwise, they show the user a
bunch of errors, which leads to a bad user experience.

Continuing with the Soccer club app in the resources example, the following could represent the
app’s pages:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Create strategy
    roles:
      - $team:manager
    blocks: # …

  - name: Strategies
    roles:
      - $team:member
    blocks:
      - type: action-button
        version: 0.20.40
        roles: $team:member
        actions:
          onClick:
            link: Create strategy
      -  # …

  - name: Report absence
    roles:
      - $team:member
    blocks: # …

  - name: View absence
    roles:
      - $team:manager
    blocks: # …

  - name: About
    blocks: # …
```

According to this app definition, only the team manager may view the pages called `Create strategy`
and `View absence`. Any team members may view the `Strategies` and `Report absence` pages, but on
the `Strategies` page, only team managers see a button which links to `Create strategy`. This means
anyone who isn’t part of a team, can’t see any of those pages. The `About` page is accessible to
anyone.

## Actions

The following team related actions are can be used within an app:

- [`team.invite`](/docs/reference/action#team.invite)
- [`team.join`](/docs/reference/action#team.join)
- [`team.list`](/docs/reference/action#team.list)
