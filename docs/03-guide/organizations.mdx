# Organizations

An organization represents a collective name for groups of apps, blocks, and users. In order to
publish new blocks or to create and manage apps, the user needs to be in an organization.

## Creating an organization

Organizations can freely be made in the Appsemble studio by visiting the settings page and clicking
on “Organizations” in the menu. From here you can view a list of organizations that you are already

organization ID **must** be unique and cannot be changed after it has been created. This ID is used
to determine which blocks are used in an app as well as where the app should be hosted by default.

## Organization members

After creating an organization, members can be added via email. This email will contain a link that
the recipient can click on in order to accept or decline joining the organization.

Organization members can be assigned roles that affect which parts of the studio they have access
to. Each role has all the permission of the previous role in the list.

These roles are the following:

- `Member`: The default role for new members. Organization members are able to view private apps

- `API Reader`: A role that has permissions to view the app’s resources and assets, particularly
  useful if the user wants to use the app’s API.
- `API User`: Similar to `API Reader`, but with additional write permissions for the app’s resources
  and assets.
- `AppEditor`: App editors are allowed to edit existing apps, manage an app’s resources, provid
