# SAML2.0

Appsemble supports login to apps using SAML2.0 identity providers (IDP). This allows users to login
using Single Sign On (SSO), for example using Microsoft Azure AD. In this case Appsemble Studio
serves as the SAML2.0 service provider (SP).

## Flows

Users may try to access an application from one of the following flows:

- Service Provider (SP) flow. From a browser, the user attempts to go directly to the web resource
  without authenticating. The user is redirected to the IDP to authenticate. Once authenticated the
  user is redirected back to the web resource. **This flow is supported in Appsemble**
- Identity provider (IDP) flow. The user launches applications to the service provider (SP)
  resource. In Enterprise Application Access (EAA), this happens from the EAA Login Portal after the
  user authenticates them. When the user clicks on an application icon, a SAML assertion
  (authentication) is sent over to the SP Assertion Consumer Service (ACS). The user is signed into
  the service and does not need to enter their credentials again. **This flow is currently
  unsupported in Appsemble**

## Configuration

Configuration options for SAML2.0 can be found in the _Secrets_ page of the app details.

The following properties can be filled in without restrictions. Use values that best match your app.

- **Name**: The name that will be displayed on the login button.
- **Icon**: A Font Awesome icon. A list of available icons can be found
  [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free)

The following values depend on the SAML2.0 IDP that is being configured.

- **Login endpoint**: This is the URL where users will be redirected to perform a login. Typically
  this is a URL that ends on `/saml/login`.
- **Identity provider entity ID**: This is the URL that serves the SAML2.0 metadata. Typically this
  is a URL that ends on `/saml/metadata.xml`. Alternatively the identity provider certificate may be
  provided.
- **Identity provider certificate**: This is the certificate for the SAML2.0 formatted as PEM.
  Alternatively the entity ID may be provided.

When the secret is saved, some values will be generated that are required by the IDP. Which values
exactly arr required, depends on the IDP.

## Login flow

The following diagram describes the login flow to Appsemble apps using third party SAML2.0
providers.

    App-->>Appsemble Studio: Get Appsemble token

  end
  Note right of App: The user is now logged in.
```

Note that user accounts are always linked to Appsemble. This allows for assigning user roles within
an app or organization. The step in the login flow where the user gets redirected to the Appsemble
Studio should be fast enough for users to not notice this technical detail.
