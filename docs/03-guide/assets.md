# Assets

Assets can be used to store binary data. Typically this is used for example for images, videos,
audio fragments, or documents. They can be used by app creators, content managers who use Appsemble
Studio, and end users of the app.

Assets consist of binary data, an auto-generated ID, and optionally a name. The asset can be
referenced in the API by its ID or name. The name must be unique within the app. Assets can’t be
changed. In order to change them, they need to be deleted and uploaded again.

Assets can typically be used for 2 use cases:

- To link binary data to a [resource](./resources.md).
- To store static app assets that can be referenced in the app definition or custom CSS.

## Resources

When creating a resource, it’s possible to link binary assets to it. These assets are unnamed. For
more information, see the [resource assets](./resources.md#assets) guide.

## Studio

Assets can be viewed, downloaded, uploaded, and deleted from the _Details_ side menu of a single app
view, given that the user has the correct permissions. When uploading an asset, a name can be
entered through which the asset can be referenced in the API.

## CLI

Assets can be uploaded using the [Appsemble CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appsemble/cli).

```sh
appsemble asset create --app-id "$MY_APP_ID" path/to/example.png
```

By default the base name of the file will be used as the asset name. I.e. the asset created using
the command above, would be named _“example”_.

## SDK

The Appsemble SDK allows block developers to resolve asset links using the `asset()` utility. Block
developers are encouraged to embrace this API. This way app developers can simply pass asset IDs or
URLs into block parameters or resources, without worrying about where binary data comes from.

```ts
bootstrap(({ utils }) => {
  // Logs for example https://appsemble.app/api/apps/1/assets/my-asset
  console.log(utils.asset('my-asset'));

  // Logs https://example.com/image.png
  console.log(utils.asset('https://example.com/image.png'));
});
```

## Security

Assets can be referenced from a public API endpoint. The IDs are generated using UUID version 4,
which is cryptographically secure, but the endpoints don’t require any further authentication. Also
named assets can be referenced by their name. It’s not recommended to use the asset API for
sensitive information.
