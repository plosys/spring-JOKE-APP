# Tips and tricks

Here is an overview of Tips and Tricks when working in Appsemble Studio

## **Changing Indentation**

Select the code: use TAB to indent to the right and use SHIFT + TAB to indent to the left

## **Saving the file**

To save the file you can press `CTRL + S` or on a mac `CMD + S`

## **Remark**

When you want to add a remark or extra information that is not part of the code you can add a `'#'`
in front of that line.

You could also toggle the remark symbol to complete code blocks by selecting the all the lines you
want to remark and then press `CTRL + /` or on a mac `CMD + /`

## **Code suggestions**

While coding your application you can press `CTRL + SPACE` to show suggestions on how to complete
the code. This can be incredibly handy when you have to choose an item from a list, like an action.
