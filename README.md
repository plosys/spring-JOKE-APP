# ![](config/assets/logo.svg) Appsemble

> The app building platform

## Usage

These are instructions for developing the Appsemble core platform. Production setup instructions can
be found in [here](docs/04-deployment/helm.md).

### Live Environments

Our production environment is available on [appsemble.app](https://appsemble.app).

Our staging environment is available on
[staging.appsemble.review](https://staging.appsemble.review). This environment hosts the latest
changes in the `main` branch. This environment is reset every night at 04:00 AM UTC.

For each of our internal merge requests a review environment is started at
`${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID}.appsemble.review`.

### Requirements

**Minimum Hardware Requirements**

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU      | 1 GHz   | >2 GHz      |
| CPUs     | 1       | 2>          |
| RAM      | 12GB    | 16GB>       |
| Disk     | 3 GiB   | >           |

**Software Requirements**

In order to run the Appsemble project in development mode on Linux, macOS or Windows, the following
must be installed.

- [Docker][]
- [Docker Compose][]
- [NodeJS 18][nodejs]
- [Yarn][]

### Getting started

Clone and setup the project.

> Note: your CLI should have elevated privileges when setting up and starting the app

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/appsemble/appsemble.git
cd appsemble
yarn
```

The project requires a PostgreSQL database. This project contains a Docker Compose configuration to
spin up a preconfigured database with ease.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The project can be served using the following command.

```sh
yarn start
```

To see additional options, run the following command.

```sh
yarn start --help
```

A new account can be registered by going to `http://localhost:9999/register`. Later you can login on
`http://localhost:9999/login`. If you use email registration to register an account, the email
containing the verification link will be printed in the server logs. You need to click this link in
order to use your account.

#### CLI Login

To login using the Appsemble CLI, run the following command.

```sh
yarn appsemble login
```

> Note: when using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) the module `keytar` is not installed by
> default. The workaround for this is manually adding OAuth2 credentials and passing them to the CLI
> using `--client-credentials=`.

This will open Appsemble studio in a new window in your browser. A panel will pop up where you must
select the permissions you need. You will need to select at least _blocks:write_,
_organizations:write_ and _apps:write_ to complete the steps below. Clicking confirm creates an
OAuth2 access token, which is required in order to publish blocks and apps. Click register and your
OAuth2 client credentials will be shown. This will be required when you proceed with the publishing
blocks and apps steps below.

#### Registering an Organization

To get started developing locally, an Appsemble organization identified through id: `appsemble`
needs to be created. This organization can be created either in Appsemble Studio, or using the
following CLI command.

```sh
yarn appsemble organization create --name Appsemble appsemble
```

#### Publishing Blocks

After logging in to the CLI, Appsemble blocks can be published locally by running the following
command.

```sh
yarn appsemble block publish blocks/*
```

If prompted, select the OAuth2 credential you created earlier to proceed. You will now see the
published blocks in the `Block store` page.

Any block that is found within the workspaces listed in `package.json` will be hot-reloaded. More
information about block development and hot-reloading can be found
[here](https://appsemble.app/docs/development/developing-blocks).

#### Publishing App templates

In order for users to create apps from within the Appsemble Studio, existing apps that can be used
as a starting point must be marked as templates. This can be done using the Appsemble CLI, after
logging in. To publish these apps, run the following command.

```sh
yarn appsemble app create --context development apps/*
```

The published apps will be displayed on the `App store` page.

### Tests

Tests can be run using the following command.

```sh
yarn test
```

The tests are ran using jest, meaning all [jest CLI options][] can be passed.

By default, database tests are run against the database as specified in
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). The database can be overridden by setting the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Note that this should **not** include the database name.
Multiple test databases are created at runtime.

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:password@localhost:5432 yarn test
```

### Building

The resulting Docker image can be built using the Docker CLI.

```sh
docker build --tag appsemble .
```
