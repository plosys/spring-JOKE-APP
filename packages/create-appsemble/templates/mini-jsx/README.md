This block was bootstrapped using the following command:

```sh
npm init appsemble block
```

This block renders a single data entity that is emitted through an Appsemble block event. It uses
[`mini-jsx`](https://gitlab.com/appsemble/mini-jsx) to define raw DOM nodes using JSX syntax.

This readme will be rendered on <https://appsemble.app> when the block is published. Replace the
contents of this document with a useful block description.
